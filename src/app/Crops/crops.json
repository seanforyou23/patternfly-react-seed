To grow, transplant plugs or crowns in early spring in rows spaced at least 120cm apart. Pinch off all flowers the first season and train the plant's runners, pressing them into the soil 15-22cm apart from the mother plant. Mulch with straw or pine needles in the fall when the plants have died back. When the plants start to grow back in the spring, move the mulch aside. After harvest the second season, set a lawnmower to about 10cm high and mow, being sure not to damage crowns.\n\n The other two types are \n\n2) Ever-bearing and 3) Day Neutral, both of which send out less runners and bear several crops of smaller fruit throughout the season. These two types can be grown using raised beds about 20cm high and 60cm wide. Transplant crowns or plugs in staggered double rows, about 30cm apart. Remove runners and flowers until July of the first year to give the roots time to develop, and then allow plants to produce fruit. All types of strawberries begin to produce fewer and less sweet fruit once they are two years or older. Because strawberries are a hybrid, seeds will not breed true. Strawberries are predominantly propagated using bare root plugs or crowns or dividing runners.

The edible part of the plant is a bundle of leaf sheaths that is sometimes erroneously called a stem or stalk. Historically, many scientific names were used for leeks, but they are now all treated as cultivars of A. ampeloprasum. The name 'leek' developed from the Anglo-Saxon word \"leac\". Two closely related vegetables, elephant garlic and kurrat, are also cultivars of A. ampeloprasum, although different in their uses as food. The onion and garlic are also related, being other species of the genus Allium.\nLeeks have thick blue-green foliage. The bundle of white leaf sheaths has a mild onion taste and can be blanched, steamed, braised, or grilled and used in soups, stews, omelet fillings, and more. The leaves can be used to make stock.\n\nPlant their leeks in autumn, and they should fatten up in time for winter picking. Plant them early to ensure they have enough time to grow before winter. Leeks take up to six months to mature after transplanting.\n\nNewer cultivars have quicker maturity – three to four months. Maturity is often affected by temperature, available nutrients and water. \n\nLeeks need a soil that is rich in organic matter. Dig in compost or manure two weeks before planting. Add fertiliser every few weeks\nLeeks like aged manure, especially chicken manure, and worm castings, another excellent source of nutrients.\n\nPlant seedlings in full sun, with moist but well-drained deep soil. Raised beds are ideal. Water young plants frequently.\n\nThe white part of the leek is edible; the green is not.

The fruit of most species contains capsaicin, which gives hot peppers their spiciness. Bell peppers (Capsicum annuum) are an exception: they do not contain capsaicin due to a recessive gene, and are therefore not spicy. The Scoville scale is used to measure the relative heat of peppers. Bell peppers have a rating of 0-25 Scoville Heat Units (SHU), jalapenos are between 2,500-10,000 SHU. All peppers, regardless of species, prefer a long, warm growing season and well-drained soil high in organic matter. Seeds can be started indoors 8-10 weeks before hardening off and transplanting. In cooler climates, it can be preferable to grow peppers in containers indoors to extend the growing season and prevent frost from killing plants.

Chayote is native to Mesoamerica and thrives in a subtropical to tropical climate, although it can be grown in other regions in containers. It needs 120-150 frost-free days to reach harvest. Like cucumbers, it has a sprawling growth pattern and benefits from trellising - fruit will rot if it sits on the soil. It's pale green fruit can be 10-20cm long and resembles a flattened, wrinkled pear. It's green to white flesh has a mild taste like a cross between a potato and a cucumber. It is usually lightly cooked like summer squash. The tubers are starchy and eaten like potatoes. The shoots and heart-shaped leaves can be added to salads and stir-fries.","slug":"chayote","alternate_names":["christophene","christophine","cho-cho","mirliton","merleton","chuchu","pear squash","vegetable pear","chouchoute","choko","ishkus","chowchow"],"scientific_names":["Sechium edule"],"photos_count":3,"plantings_count":6,"harvests_count":13,"planters_ids":[131,131,131,1390,1168,1168],"has_photos":true,"thumbnail_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/59d3d18935bc1f0004000257.jpg?1507053959","scientific_name":"Sechium edule","created_at":1363656625,"id":"46"},{"_index":"crops_production_20200824003628370","_type":"_doc","_id":"135","_score":4.787492,"name":"New Zealand spinach","description":"New Zealand Spinach is a warm-weather spinach alternative that is not directly related to spinach, but has a similar flavor and texture.

It belongs to the genus Prunus which includes the cherry, apricot, almond, and plum. The peach is classified with the almond in the subgenus Amygdalus because their stones are corrugated rather than smooth. Peaches and nectarines are the same species - nectarines have a recessive gene that makes their skin smooth rather than fuzzy. Cultivated peaches are divided into two groups: clingstones and freestones, depending on whether the flesh sticks to the stone or not. Peaches can have white or yellow fuzzy skin. Yellow peaches usually have an acidic tang coupled with sweetness. White peaches are very sweet with little acidity. Most cultivars require 500 hours of chilling around 0 to 10 °C during the winter, and hot temperatures in the summer to ripen fruit. Some varieties are self-pollinating, while others require pollination by a peach tree of another variety with the same bloom period within 50 feet. Peaches should be thinned to 7-12cm apart when fruit are 2-3cm in diameter to increase mature fruit size. Standard and dwarf rootstocks are available. Dwarf trees can grow to 3 meters, standard to 4.5 meters. Depending on the size chosen, the tree will bear fruit within 2-4 years of planting.","slug":"peach","alternate_names":[],"scientific_names":["Prunus persica"],"photos_count":6,"plantings_count":6,"harvests_count":5,"planters_ids":[807,1136,1136,258,44,6306],"has_photos":true,"thumbnail_url":"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4156/34301504501_36ea3d3822_z.jpg","scientific_name":"Prunus persica","created_at":1363656628,"id":"147"},{"_index":"crops_production_20200824003628370","_type":"_doc","_id":"254","_score":4.0073333,"name":"aloe vera","description":"Aloe Vera is an evergreen succulent with thick, fleshy leaves with serrated edges.
